2. ✅ Week 2: Database schema fixes
3. ✅ Week 5: Smart Reminders foundation (currently placeholder)
4. ✅ Week 11: Security audit & compliance
5. ✅ Week 12: E2E testing

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Security setup
- Database fixes

### Phase 2: Brain Dump Only (Weeks 3-4)
- Complete Brain Dump module
- Skip Clusters for now
- Basic filtering only

### Phase 3: Basic Maps (Week 5)
- Map generation (already works)
- Skip replan and stuck features

### Phase 4: Basic Reminders (Week 6)
- Simple time-based reminders only
- Skip NL processing and DND

### Phase 5: Testing & Launch (Weeks 7-8)

## 🤝 Need Help?

### Stuck on a task?
1. Check the [Full Checklist](./PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Review the [specification docs](../6fe7c071-e8af-40df-a7e4-3b4b3cae3321_ExportBlock-3b2c7905-eb69-4dbe-877b-89bfc133ca2a/ExportBlock-3b2c7905-eb69-4dbe-877b-89bfc133ca2a-Part-1/)
3. Ask for help (include specific error/issue)

### Priority Conflicts?
- Security > Core Features > Polish
- Fix data model before building UI
- Test as you build, not after

### Timeline Slipping?
- Cut scope, not quality
- Focus on MVP fast track
- Defer nice-to-haves
- Keep security & testing
